The Manty-Hall paradox is as follows:
1. There are TV-show, where there are 3 doors. Behind one of the doors there is a prize,
   but there is nothing behind the other doors.
2. The participant of the TV-show choices one of the three doors, then the host of the
   TV-show (who knows the door with the prize) opens one of the two doors (which are not
   selected by the participant), where there is no prize.
3. The participant has the opportunity to change the previous choice.
4. Will the chances of winning increase after changing the original choice?
